DMX Unit is a communication unit specifically designed for DMX-512 data transmission scenarios. It integrates the CA-IS3092W isolated half-duplex RS-485 transceiver, providing up to 5kVrms electrical isolation protection. The onboard 120Î© termination resistor switch matches the characteristic impedance of the signal transmission line, preventing signal reflection and distortion, and can be connected according to the usage scenario. The built-in DC-DC converter provides independent power supply for the system. Through the Grove interface, it communicates with the M5 host via serial communication. The device is equipped with an XLR-3 female interface, making it convenient for users to connect DMX devices. This product is suitable for stage lighting control, landscape lighting control, dimmer control, and other scenarios.
